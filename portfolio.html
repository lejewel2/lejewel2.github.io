                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>Growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina, a very progressive city, communication, as well as personal interactions, have always come naturally to me. My business was always
                    avaliable to everyone via social media, and I was very involved in the community. In middle school, I moved to rural, Western Kentucky. You can imagine the impact that had on my social skills as well as my lifestyle. I became introverted and resorted to
                    my love of art to cope with the loss of my old life. At that time, I also became very fascinated with technology. And In high school, I discovered my love of computers and communication on a new level. 
                </p>
                <h3>My Background</h3>
                <p>I am currently a student in an immersive program sponcered by General Aseembly through Interapt. I have worked with Git Bash, HTML, CSS, and Visual Studio Code.
